# IoMT-Based ECG Acquisition for Monitoring Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

The electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical signals generated by the heart with electrodes placed on various parts of the body. This project uses a low-cost 3-electrode ECG sensor to continuously monitor heart rate and heart rate variabiability with high accuracy. 

The raw ECG signal is first filtered using MODWT (Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform). The Wavelet toolbox in MATLAB was used to decide which coefficients had to be chosen to extract the R-peaks with a sym4 wavelet and 4 levels of decomposition. You can learn more about filtering the ECG signal using MODWT from MATLAB's documentation.
